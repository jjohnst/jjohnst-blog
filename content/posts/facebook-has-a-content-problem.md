*Note: I began writing this piece several months ago but never got around to finishing it. Some of the news is old, but the idea is still the same.*

Several weeks ago I quit Facebook. I know, way to get on the bandwagon, but I really just found that I was not gaining anything from the service, especially the News Feed. However, I was pretty reliant on the messaging component of Facebook, mainly for my friends outside of the U.S. , so I downloaded Facebook Messenger. Point being, I thought I was done with Facebook. That is until I discovered Facebook was coming out with a new mobile app called Paper. It was almost as if Facebook had heard me complaining about it, hopefully that isn’t true. I was really looking forward to see what Paper had to offer. I downloaded it with an open mind and spent about 30 minutes playing around with it. I was impressed with the UI and the animations, but after those 30 minutes I closed the app and uninstalled it. That’s because I realized that Facebook does not have a delivery problem. Facebook has a content problem. It’s not that the News Feed or Paper is too overwhelming, it’s that the overall quality of the content is lacking.

## The Trade-off
There seems to be a trade-off that has been developing on the internet. You either have predominantly user generated content i.e. Facebook & Twitter, or you have predominantly curated content. In order to keep users actively involved and scale to millions of users it seems almost necessary to have most of the content be user generated. However, as you can see on Facebook and Twitter quality content does not scale by nature. Twitter at least tries to reward quality content creators or at least interesting content creators by allowing users to follow other users. On the other end curated services can take more time and money to run and can seem distanced from the user because the user is not actively participating in the creation of content. However, a higher quality of content usually correlates to a better user experience. So how can a service find a balance between these two poles?

## Is There a Solution?
Medium has tried to find a “happy medium” between these two extremes. Originally Medium was completely curated with only certain people being able to post. Now, Medium allows anyone to post, but still has users who curate collections. This seems to be a good balance as the overall quality of the content on Medium is relatively high. However, are there other solutions? Perhaps the content itself could be curated and users could just be allowed to discuss or edit the content. This would keep user engagement high, while trying to maintain the content quality. Facebook could not use this solution because it would destroy the self-expression aspect of the service. A solution could be to limit the amount of content a user can create, which in turn may increase the quality of the content. It seems as if there are many potential solutions, services must be willing to experiment in order to find a balance that works.
