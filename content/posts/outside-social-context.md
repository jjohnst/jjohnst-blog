When was the last time you took a selfie or posted a status update? For many of us it was no longer than a few hours ago. Today’s technological world revolves around social media and excessive sharing. Our society celebrates uniqueness and individualism but we are never allowed the time to appreciate and explore our own identities without social context. We are constantly broadcasting ourselves to our friends and to the world without ever understanding the impact it has on us. This raises the question, “Can technology be used for self-reflection?”.

## The Problem
The Internet is a great tool for sharing and expressing one’s self. However, the real-time nature of many services leaves us reacting and attempting to keep up instead of reflecting.
Constantly sharing and receiving information without ever taking the time to reflect on it really deducts from the power of the information. It is important to understand what we are taking in and how it is affecting us. A lot of what we share can be understood at a deeper than surface level. I think that the Internet and technology as a whole can also be a great tool for reflection.

## The Concept
The recent trend in personal analytics and health tracking technologies demonstrates that people are interested in reflecting on themselves in a more personal manner. However, personal reflection and growth are more than just statistics and achievements. There is a human element to them as well. Thus, it is equally as important to allow users to input information and data on themselves. The most natural form of self-reflection is done mentally, but technology is not advanced enough today for us to track our thoughts on any consistent basis. The next logical form of self-reflection is writing. There are many services devoted to journaling, but most of them have some sort of share feature. What if there was a service that was totally disconnected from the sharing network? This service would allow you to take pictures, take notes, ask questions, store links, and save things to be viewed later, but was never meant to be shared. But if you don’t share it does it have any value?

Yes! It would be of great personal value or at least as valuable you wanted it to be. Instead of a collection of filtered selfies, self-censored posts, and frivolous reposts, this service would contain a picture of you outside of the social context. Yes, it would be influenced by the social context, but hopefully it would not be filtered by it. Services like this could act as an antechamber to more socially focused services. Ideas and identities could be developed and refined in this personal space and then shared with a larger audience upon reaching a level of maturity.

## The Results
In an ideal world, giving people more time to reflect would enhance the quality of what they share and increase the value of receiving information through a social network. However, privacy concerns could really hinder a service based solely around self-reflection. There would have to be a high level of trust between the user and the service provider in order to create an environment for reflection. Ultimately, the success of such a service would be determined by a user’s willingness to be open.
