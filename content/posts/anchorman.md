“They tell you the first rule is not to die don’t they?”

“I beg your pardon?”

“When you’re signing the release papers they always tell you that the first rule is not to die because then you can’t go back. I just assumed they told you the same thing.”

He stared at the pretty woman in the black dress, sitting two chairs down the bar, who was apparently speaking to him.

“What do you mean they?” he asked.

“I know you work for them,” she said leaning across the bar towards him. The dim overhead lighting gave her young features a chiseled, serious look.

He gave her a puzzled glance and turned back to his drink. He reached up and undid another button on his shirt. He was just trying to relax and he certainly didn’t want to talk about work.

Emboldened by his clear disregard for her, the woman got up and sat down in the chair next to him. He could smell her perfume, light and floral. She placed a manicured hand on his suit sleeve.

“Don’t be coy. You know, I’ve tried it before. I know your type…I know what you do.”

He could smell the alcohol from her drink as she spoke to him.

“I think you have me confused with someone or something else,” he said earnestly.

“Oh, so you’re not an anchorman?” she asked mockingly, tilting her head away from him.

He smirked at the term and stared back into his drink. What could this woman want with him?

“I prefer the term Reentry Specialist,” he said, still staring into his drink. What harm could come from playing her little game?

“I knew it!” she said with childlike glee as she squeezed his arm.

“I can always tell your type. Well dressed, always drinking, lonely…handsome.” She smiled seductively.

“I’ve always worried my good looks would give it away,” he said with a smirk.

“Don’t flatter yourself. The others were better looking,” she said with a touch of mock pity.

“Oh, so you’ve met others?” he asked.

“Yes, it’s kind of my hobby you might say. I find your type fascinating. You have a certain grip on reality if you know what I mean.”

He laughed to himself, “Clever”.

“You said you had experience?” he asked, turning to face her.

“Yes,” she smiled, “I broke the first rule.”

“You’re young to be a Maroon,” he said surprised.

She tucked a strand of raven hair behind her left ear and turned away.

“I just figured it wasn’t much of an experience if you were going to treat it just like reality,” she said with a shrug.

“That’s an honest way to approach it,” he said.

She looked back to him with an intensity he hadn’t seen at a distance.

“Tell me, how’d you end up as an anchorman or Reentry Specialist or whatever you want to call it?”

“You said you’ve talked to others. It’s probably pretty similar. No family left, never had kids. I wouldn’t really say that I found the job, as much as the job found me,” he said thinking back.

“I was in my mid twenties. Life hadn’t quite panned out the way I had expected so far. My mother died when I was fifteen of cancer. You know, this was before the cure. We were close, but she was always a parent to me and never a person. I don’t remember crying. My father kind of lost interest in me after that. Her death cut him deep and when they found the cure just a few years later he drowned in the what ifs. Killed himself. I was an only child, but I was grown now. It was just me then. I tried the school thing for a bit. I was a good student, but I wasn’t motivated towards anything so I left. I moved to the city, this city. I met a girl who I was happy with. That’s when this really started. You can’t be truly sad until you’ve been truly happy, you know. I know that sounds like a cliché, but it’s true. She kind of became the center of who I was. This was right about the time Effective VR was coming out. She dabbled with it in short doses, but it was expensive. I never tried it, but before long it was all she could talk about. She started saving up to be a Lifer. I tried to talk her out of it. Tried to tell her that reality wasn’t easy, but that it was solid. It was something we could build on. She wouldn’t listen. She was convinced that she had to try a version of reality where she could control how things went. She just left one morning and I never saw her or spoke to her again, but I assume she became a Lifer. Of course I was angry, but I knew deep down that I couldn’t blame her for wanting to leave reality. I thought about it myself a few times, but it was expensive and something inside of me told me that would be quitting. So there I was in the city with no family and no friends and guess who turns up?”

“Someone from Mirage,” she said knowingly.

“Exactly. Its like they track sad, lonely people,” he laughed to himself.

“Well, they make the best anchormen don’t they?” she said resting her chin in her hand.

“They do,” he said nodding to himself in agreement, “Nothing like a dose of cold, harsh reality to jolt you out of whatever fantasy world you’ve been living in.”

“So what did the person from Mirage tell you?”

“I don’t know…the truth…lies. It didn’t matter to me. He said that I could help people whose experiences had ended transition back into reality. I didn’t exactly see it that way. I wasn’t so interested in helping people as I was in finding proof that being a Lifer was terrible.”

“Oh, so you weren’t convinced?” she asked curiously.

“If you had asked me then I would have said I was absolutely convinced, but there was a nagging piece of me that wondered why people would give up everything for it. The way I saw it was I would either get proof that it was terrible or I would be able to save up enough money from the job to see for myself.”

“So, did you get your proof?”

“In some ways, yes,” he said wistfully. He paused and took another sip of his drink

“Well tell me. What did you find?” she asked as she placed her hand on his forearm.

He moved his arm and brushed his hair across his forehead.

“What you said earlier is true. They explain to you what they tell every Lifer before they go in. That as a Lifer you can die, but if you want to stay you should avoid it at all costs. They tell you that enforcing this is the only way to separate reality from fantasy. I mean you know all this. You said you tried it.”

“I do know, but I want to hear it from your perspective. Remember, it fascinates me,” she said cheekily, raising her eyebrows.

He rolled his eyes and smiled to himself.

“You know, you’re the one who asked for this story. You could be a little bit more of an agreeable audience,” he said with a playful smirk.

“Ok, ok. I really do want to hear your story. I won’t steal anymore of your thunder,” she said leaning back into her chair and crossing her legs.

He turned partially to face her and rested his cheek on his fist, which was propped up on the bar.

“I mean have you ever wondered what would happen if they didn’t enforce that rule? If you weren’t marooned in reality once you died?” he asked.

“I think people would like it,” she shrugged her shoulders, “I mean we all are just trying to escape that right? So why enforce it?”

“Because we have to separate reality from fantasy. How could we enjoy anything if we thought reality was like that all of the time?”

“You sound like an anchorman,” she laughed.

“I mean of course I’m biased,” he sighed, “But I’ve seen what happens first hand to people who have been in too long and can’t separate fantasy from reality.”

“So tell me then. What’s it like to work with Lifers?”

“I assumed most of them would’ve been in for many effective years, but I figured there would have to be some who got bored or got tired of it and left on purpose. But I’ve only ever worked with accidental exits. In fact you’re the only Maroon I’ve ever met who left on purpose.”

“Who said I left on purpose?” she asked alluringly.

“I guess I just assumed that since you’re so young you left on purpose.”

“I think that’s your bias coming out again,” she teased. “You still haven’t told me how you got your proof.”

“Well like I was saying every Lifer I worked with didn’t leave intentionally. When they come out they’re in this bright room and it’s your job to break the news to them. I mean, I guess you know since you experienced it. Mirage trains you to handle this and they try to give you techniques to make the transition smoother, but I feel like its more of an art you have to develop than a science. I’ve tried lots of different ways. I’ve tried being gentle and trying to explain their experience as a dream. I’ve tried to act as if nothing happened and wait for them to figure it out. That never worked. I even tried giving them near death experiences to see if I could jolt them into reality, but whatever I did they were always miserable.”

“So you’re not much of an artist,” she chuckled, twirling one of her dark locks between her fingers.

“I wouldn’t say that,” he scowled at her, “I talked to other anchormen and they all had similar experiences. No one wanted to be back.”

“Doesn’t sound like you got proof of what you thought you would,” she said.

“I haven’t finished my story yet,” he said with a smile.

“Oh, sounds like a twist,” she said, leaning towards him again.

“Maybe if you like dark twists,” he smirked, “There was this one Lifer I particularly remember, Eric Lewis. He was in his late sixty’s. He had been in for nearly twenty real years, something like 125 effective years. We get profiles on all of the Lifers we transition. I can still see his pretty clearly. He was wealthy, successful. His wife and children had died in a fire around the holidays a few years before he went in. He was actually prescribed Effective VR as a treatment. This was before we knew that it wasn’t great for helping your mental state.”

“Yeah, who would’ve thought,” she muttered to herself.

“Anyways, he comes out and his eyes are just empty. It took me something like three hours to even get him to respond to me. He finally sits up and says to me, ‘I know where am.’ Since you’ve talked to anchormen before I’m sure you know, but we’re only assigned two or three Lifers at a time. I mean, its literally our job to help them transition back into reality. We pretty much have to hold their hand for the first few weeks and then after that we’re available to them twenty-four/seven until they’re deemed completely transitioned.”

“I can imagine that’s why the job pays so well,” she said with a smirk.

“It’d be nice to have some time to use that money,” he said lightly, “Eric was a special case. The handholding phase was short. Within a week he was back living independently, but he couldn’t pass the Transition test. We used to meet everyday to discuss the things he had missed during his experience. He always just kind of accepted what I said and we’d move on to something different. He never spoke too much. He just seemed tired, like reality was too much for him. That’s how all Lifers seemed, but eventually they found a routine and sauntered back into a meager existence.”

“So what made Eric special?” she asked.

“Eric seemed like he was actually missing something,” he said pensively, “Like he had discovered something real during his experience. Not something that was just fleeting and pleasurable. Something tangible and solid and now it was gone. I had never really asked a Lifer about their experience because I didn’t want them to long for it, but I couldn’t resist with Eric. During one of our meetings I finally asked him what he had found during his experience. I’ll never forget the look on his face when I asked. For a second he flashed into reality. As if something I said brought him into the moment. He said, ‘I can show you’ ”

“Like, he’d show you something physical?” she asked inquisitively.

“I didn’t know. I just said ok and we agreed to meet later that night. When I got to his house he was eerily present. I mean you have to understand that he always just seemed to be going through the motions. But on this night there was something in his eyes. We walked into his kitchen and he pointed to an object on the counter. I walked over and stopped. It was a gun. I had never held one, but I felt compelled to pick it up. I remember the cold metal, the weight. It felt dangerous, but it also felt like control. I thought maybe this was what everyone was seeking in their fantasies.”

“What did you do?” she asked urging him on.

A puzzled look crossed his face and he reached up and touched his temple.

He thought back to the bright light filling his eyes. He remembered being on his back and the way his body felt as if it were floating forward weightlessly. He remembered coming to a gradual halt and he had looked up to see a woman with shoulder length raven hair in a black dress standing over him.

He looked back at the woman sitting next him at the bar.

She smiled, “You see, it is an art.”
